DotFiles
========

My Dotfiles highly inspired of others Dotfiles, which were highly inspired of others Dotfiles, and so on.

To install, clone this repository into ~/.dotifiles and cd into it :

    git clone --recursive http://github.com/vphilippon/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles

Don't forget to add the `--recursive` option to get all the submodules used for vim plugins.

Start the bash install script

    ./install.sh
